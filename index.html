                <h1>Video Games</h1>
                <p>Today, video games make up a $100 billion global industry, and nearly two-thirds of American homes
                    have
                    household members who play video games regularly. And it’s really no wonder: Video games have been
                    around
                    for decades and span the gamut of platforms, from arcade systems to home consoles, to handheld
                    consoles
                    and mobile devices. They’re also often at the forefront of computer technology.</p>

                    <h3>the early days</h3>
                    <p>Though video games are found today in homes worldwide, they actually got their start in the
                        research
                        labs of scientists. In 1952, for instance, British professor A.S. Douglas created OXO, also
                        known
                        as noughts and crosses or a tic-tac-toe, as part of his doctoral dissertation at the University
                        of
                        Cambridge. And in 1958, William Higinbotham created Tennis for Two on a large analog computer
                        and
                        connected oscilloscope screen for the annual visitor’s day at the Brookhaven National
                        Laboratory
                        in Upton, New York. In 1962, Steve Russell at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
                        invented
                        Spacewar!, a computer-based space combat video game for the PDP-1 (Programmed Data
                        Processor-1),
                        then a cutting-edge computer mostly found at universities. It was the first video game that
                        could
                        be played on multiple computer installations.

                    <h3>dawn of the home console</h3>
                    <p>In 1967, developers at Sanders Associates, Inc., led by Ralph Baer, invented a prototype
                        multiplayer,
                        multiprogram video game system that could be played on a television. It was known as “The Brown
                        Box.”
                        Baer, who’s sometimes referred to as Father of Video Games, licensed his device to Magnavox,
                        which
                        sold the system to consumers as the Odyssey, the first video game home console, in 1972. Over
                        the
                        next few years, the primitive Odyssey console would commercially fizzle and die out. Yet, one
                        of
                        the Odyssey’s 28 games was the inspiration for Atari’s Pong, the first arcade video game, which
                        the
                        company released in 1972. </p>
                    <p>In 1975, Atari released a home version of Pong, which was as successful as its arcade
                        counterpart.
                        Magnavox, along with Sanders Associates, would eventually sue Atari for copyright infringement.
                        Atari
                        settled and became an Odyssey licensee; over the next 20 years, Magnavox went on to win more
                        than
                        $100 million in copyright lawsuits related to the Odyssey and its video game patents. In 1977,
                        Atari
                        released the Atari 2600 (also known as the Video Computer System), a home console that featured
                        joysticks
                        and interchangeable game cartridges that played multi-colored games, effectively kicking off
                        the
                        second generation of the video game consoles. </p>

                    <h3>the video game crash</h3>
                    <p>In 1983, the North American video game industry experienced a major “crash” due to a number of
                        factors,
                        including an oversaturated game console market, competition from computer gaming, and a surplus
                        of
                        over-hyped, low-quality games, such as the infamous E.T., an Atari game based on the eponymous
                        movie
                        and often considered the worst game ever created. Lasting a couple of years, the crash led to
                        the
                        bankruptcy of several home computer and video game console companies.</p>
                    <p> The video game home industry began to recover in 1985 when the Nintendo Entertainment System
                        (NES),
                        called Famicom in Japan, came to the United States. The NES had improved 8-bit graphics,
                        colors,
                        sound and gameplay over previous consoles.

                    <h3>the first console war</h3>
                    <p>Also in 1989, Sega released its 16-bit Genesis console in North America as a successor to its
                        1986
                        Sega Master System, which failed to adequately compete against the NES. With its technological
                        superiority
                        to the NES, clever marketing, and the 1991 release of the Sonic the Hedgehog game, the Genesis
                        made
                        significant headway against its older rival. In 1991, Nintendo released its 16-bit Super NES
                        console
                        in North America, launching the first real “console war.”

                    <h3>the rise of 3D gaming</h3>
                    <p>With a leap in computer technology, the fifth generation of video games ushered in the
                        three-dimensional
                        era of gaming. In 1995, Sega released in North America its Saturn system, the first 32-bit
                        console
                        that played games on CDs rather than cartridges, five months ahead of schedule. This move was
                        to
                        beat Sony’s first foray into video games, the PlayStation, which sold for $100 less than the
                        Saturn
                        when it launched later that year. The following year, Nintendo released its cartridge-based
                        64-bit
                        system, the Nintendo 64. Though Sega and Nintendo each released their fair share of
                        highly-rated,
                        on-brand 3D titles, such as Virtua Fighter on the Saturn and Super Mario 64 on the Nintendo 64,
                        the
                        established video game companies couldn’t compete with Sony’s strong third-party support, which
                        helped
                        the Playstation secure numerous exclusive titles. Simply put: Sony dominated the video game
                        market
                        and would continue to do so into the next generation.</p>

            <h2>Consoles</h2>
            <p>This is a list of home video game consoles in chronological order, which includes the very first home
                video
                game consoles ever created, such as first generation Pong consoles, from the first-ever cartridge
                console
                Odyssey, ranging from the major video game companies such as Magnavox, Atari, Nintendo, Sega, NEC, 3DO,
                SNK,
                Sony, Microsoft to secondary market consoles. The list is divided into eras which are named based on
                the
                dominant console type of the era, though not all consoles of those eras are of the same type. Some eras
                are
                based on how many bits a major console could process.

                <p>Blizzard’s bracing 2004 fantasy simulation World of Warcraft introduced millions of players to the
                    concept
                    (and joys and frustrations) of massively multiplayer online worlds. Like so many influential
                    products,
                    it didn’t invent so much as refine and perfect—from the way gamers meet-up and socialize online to
                    how
                    to populate large digital worlds with satisfying stuff to do. It was one of the first games to
                    render
                    a landmass that felt “real” and un-gated, allowing players to run from one end of the continents in
                    its
                    fictional Azeroth to the other without seeing a loading screen. It also de-stigmatized and
                    normalized
                    online gaming by, over time, revealing that its millions of players (some 12 million at its peak in
                    2010)
                    were no different from non-players. The massive revenue it generated for years also spurred legions
                    of
                    game designers to try to create similar online playgrounds.</p>

                <p>“You have died of dysentery.” The Oregon Trail’s notorious proclamation of ultimate doom was only
                    part
                    of the software’s brutal charm. As a simulation of Westward Expansion consisting of a
                    choose-your-own-adventure
                    strategy and hunt-to-survive gameplay, it was rudimentary. But in part because it was originally
                    developed
                    in 1971 by three student teachers at Carleton College in Minnesota as an educational tool, The
                    Oregon
                    Trail found a captive—and willing—audience in thousands of classrooms across the country equipped
                    with
                    Apple II computers in the 1980s. There, it helped introduce an entire generation (several, in fact)

                    video games.</p>

            <p>It’s 1985, the Nintendo Entertainment System has invaded American living rooms, and brothers Mario and
                Luigi
                are running rampant through the Mushroom Kingdom. They’re stomping on goombas, de-shelling winged
                turtles,
                bashing question mark blocks and lobbing fireballs—like this is totally normal plumber behavior.
                (Clearly
                the 1970s drugs worked.) Yet however bizarre this side-scroller seems at face value, it’s also as
                insanely
                fun to play today as it was three decades ago. And in the wake of Mario’s nonstop running, this
                platformer
                par excellence turned the NES into a must-have appliance, Mario into a beloved gaming franchise and
                Nintendo
                into a household name. Talk about grabbing the flag.</p>

                <p>Sure, there&rsquo;s undeniable nostalgia associated with this 1986 NES classic, but there&rsquo;s no
                    arguing
                    how engrossing the original Zelda was to play. Mixing upgradable weapons with a (then) sprawling
                    map
                    and some pretty good puzzles, Link&rsquo;s original adventure delivered an experience unlike
                    anything
                    console players had experienced. Shigeru Miyamoto, the game&rsquo;s legendary designer, set out to
                    create
                    a world that felt like a &ldquo;miniature garden that [players] can put inside their drawer.&rdquo;
                    And
                    through the cartridge&rsquo;s ability to save games (the first console title to offer the option)
                    they
                    could do exactly that. Instead of toiling to beat Zelda in a single sitting, players could instead
                    pace
                    themselves, scrutinizing every last nook and cranny of Hyrule at leisure—an obsession that&rsquo;s
                    continued
                    through all 18 games (and counting) in this storied series.</p>

                <p>Swedish studio Mojang’s indie bolt from the blue turns out to be that rare example of a game whose
                    title
                    perfectly sums up its gameplay: you mine stuff, then you craft it. At its simplest, Minecraft is a
                    procedurally
                    generated exercise in reorganizing bits of information—all those cubes of dirt and rock and ore
                    strewn
                    about landscapes plucked from 1980s computers—into recognizable objects and structures and
                    mechanisms.
                    Or put another way: part spreadsheet, part Bonsai pruning. Since its launch in November 2011, it’s
                    sold
                    over 100 million copies, colonized virtually every computing platform, spawned an official
                    “Education
                    Edition” tailored for classrooms and inspired feats of mad grandeur, like this attempt to model
                    staggering
                    swathes of George R.R. Martin’s Song of Ice and Fire. Has there ever been a game as impactful as

                <p>The “Ms.” may have gotten her start as a knockoff of the original pellet-chomping arcade cabinet,
                    but
                    she’s got way more moves than her husband. An unlicensed modification of 1980’s Pac-Man, this 1982
                    game
                    was initially called “Crazy Otto”—until the developers sold it to Midway, which branded it Ms.
                    Pac-Man
                    to lure female gamers. But Ms. Pac-Man did much more than put a bow on an already wildly popular
                    game.
                    With four mazes (compared to Pac-Man’s one), smarter ghosts and on-the-move fruit bonuses, it
                    quickly
                    obsoleted the original. The fact that it’s still fun to play gives it a high perch on this list.
                    Admit
                    it—if you came across a Ms. Pac-Man cabinet in the wild, you’d drop a quarter in. Heck, you’d

                    1993 classic pit an unnamed space Marine against the forces of Hell, plunging gamers into a

                    battle for Earth. Another id title, Wolfenstein 3D, may have arrived a year earlier. But Doom
                    became
                    a true phenomenon, introducing millions of gamers to what have become bedrock principles of the

                    from frenzied multiplayer deathmatches to player-led mods that can alter or completely overhaul a

                <p>Longtime pointy-eared and green-trousered protagonist Link’s 1998 Nintendo 64 odyssey through a
                    vast,
                    three-dimensionally exquisite version of Hyrule routinely tops “best” games lists for several
                    reasons.
                    Its approach to letting players explore a 3D world was so consummate and sublime, that it felt less
                    like
                    Nintendo shoehorning eureka concepts into a new paradigm, than the paradigm-bending to Nintendo
                    whims.
                    Its clockwork puzzles, artful area and dungeon levels, and breakthrough interface—we can thank
                    Nintendo
                    for intuitive lock-on targeting that preserves our freedom to execute other actions—were so
                    groundbreaking,
                    they’re reverently hat-tipped by just about every designer, prompting some to call the game a
                    “walking
                    patent office.”</p>

                <p>Mario’s brick-breaking, Goomba-stomping antics were enough to mesmerize the world’s gamers in
                    Nintendo’s
                    idiosyncratic side-scrolling Super Mario Bros. games. But 1996’s Super Mario 64 transported
                    Nintendo
                    fans into Mario’s universe as no other game in the series had, simultaneously laying out a grammar
                    for
                    how to interact with 3D worlds (and in its case, divinely zany ones). At more than 11 million
                    copies
                    sold, it was one of the bestselling games for the Nintendo 64, but its real impact was arguably
                    off-platform,
                    where it tectonically shifted the design imperatives of an entire industry. As Rockstar co-founder
                    and
                    Grand Theft Auto V cowriter Dan Houser put it: “Anyone who makes 3-D games who says they’ve not
                    borrowed
                    something from Mario or Zelda [on Nintendo 64] is lying.”</p>

                <p>Designed by a Russian computer scientist, mass-distributed by a Japanese company and devoured by
                    gamers—casual
                    or compulsive—around the world, Tetris has been a global phenomenon since its arrival in 1984. In
                    1989,
                    Nintendo put the legendary tile-matching puzzler on the NES and Game Boy, where it catapulted the
                    latter
                    to meteoric success. It’s been available on nearly every platform since, a testament to our
                    never-ending
                    zeal for stacking blocks. However addictive, Tetris also appears to have modest health benefits,
                    like
                    cravings control and PTSD prevention. Devotees would probably nod and note how much a high-scoring,
                    in-the-zone
                    session can feel like meditation. And speaking of Zen, the game’s also generated its share of life
                    lessons,
                    including this apocryphal truism: “If Tetris has taught me anything, it’s that errors pile up and
                    accomplishments
                    disappear.”
